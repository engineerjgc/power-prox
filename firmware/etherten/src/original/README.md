# Original Code

This code was completed in ~2014 for the initial instance of the power proxy controller.

This code was copied from the original Cloudstation flat-file storage, and as such has no specific version history associated with it.  However, it does appear to be exactly the code last left programmed in the EtherTen board, so is most likely where development stopped.
